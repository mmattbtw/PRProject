# PRProject
This was for my web design class. I made the most out of the limited (and heavily blocked) internet we have at school, hope you enjoy it :^) mmatt.net/PRProject

Here is the original rules we had to have for this project:

```
Congratulation, you have just been hired to create a webpages about your favorite band/singer. This group/person is starting a world tour in 2022 and you have to include this in your site.

You will need a home page describing the band with pictures and a description about the band and their genre of music.

You will need one displaying their albums/digital releases for their career. You can describe if the song was used in a commercial, TV show, or film.

You will need to add with all the tour dates for 2012. You will need to include a page with merchandise and prices for each piece.

You need to include a page about why this is your favorite band. When did you start listening to them and why they are your favorite music creator/creators?

Include a source page for all information that you use.

It has to have color on the page and images with text wrapped

Also, it needs to include color headings, email link (you can make up one) and an embedded style sheet, ordered or unordered list (2), pictures that are aligned to the left and right of the page with the word wrap for the pictures. You will also need to use a background color and your heading need to have a different color that the background (not black), and a banner at the top with the logo and band name.

It has to attract the attention of web users.

Remember, Check Spelling/Grammar!!!!

It cannot include curse words or any inappropriate images!!!!!!!!!!!!!
